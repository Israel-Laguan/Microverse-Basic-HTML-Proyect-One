# Microverse-Basic-HTML-Proyect-One
This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of youtube video player page.

We used BEM namming conventions, for better visibility than regular semantic HTML.
We used Sass to organize our folder structure.
We populated the sidebar using Javascript.

HTML validated.

Cheers!
